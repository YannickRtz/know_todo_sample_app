# Knowunity Todo Case Study

Created by Yannick Rietz as a case study for my application as Flutter Developer at Knowunity.

## Description

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my case study. In this readme I will provide a little more info about my process.

I used this opportunity to try out some new Flutter packages that I heard good things about. One of those is Riverpod, which, according to the job posting, is also used at Knowunity. I enjoyed working with it for this case study. In comparison to using flutter_bloc I needed much less boilerplate code and the API seems well suited for REST APIs.

I took me roughly four hours to put this together, I will include the git repository, so you can also see my commit messages. I tried to cover a lot of important bases, but of course, I am aware of the many things that are still missing in my implementation. Among them are:

- Unit Tests and Widget Tests
- Features like hiding Todos, deleting Todos etc.
- Handling of network problems, e.g. undo a local change or try again at a later time
- Nice UI-Design
- Separate data and domain model for Todos
- etc.

I'm looking forward to talking to you.
